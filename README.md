# Oil-Price-Prediction

Project Objective : This is project is based on the prediction of Future Trend of Oil Price using Machine Learning and Deep Learning based model.

As the economy will be highly affected by oil prices our model will help to undestand the pattern in prices to help to the customers and businesses to smart decision.

This dataset contains daily brend crude oil prices starting from may 20th may 1987.

Mty goal was to predict the 21st day window pricing based on the 20 days window.
